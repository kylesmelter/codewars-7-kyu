// A zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers is given. The dominator of array arr is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of arr.
// For example, consider array arr such that arr = [3,4,3,2,3,1,3,3]
// The dominator of arr is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of arr and 5 is more than a half of 8.
// Write a function dominator(arr) that, given a zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers, returns the dominator of arr. The function should return âˆ’1 if array does not have a dominator. All values in arr will be >=0.

    // along with their number of appearances

    // Next, we'll use a for-loop to iterate over the parameter, 'arr'
    for(let i = 0; i <= arr.length - 1; i++) {
      // Inside the loop, we'll create a variable, 'current,' that will store
      // the current value of the loop
      let current = arr[i];
      // Then, we'll add 1 to the number of appearances for the current variable
      // in our 'cache' object if it already exists, or we'll set it equal to 1
