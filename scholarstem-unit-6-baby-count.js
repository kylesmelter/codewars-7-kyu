// DESCRIPTION:
// A local birthing center is interested in names!

// They have arrays of all the baby names they see each year, but the lists are sooo long! They donâ€™t know how to calculate how many times one name is used.

// Given an array of names and a specific name string, return the number of times that specific name appears in the array.

// countName( ["Tom","Bob","Harry","Bob"] , "Bob") //should return 2, since "Bob" shows up 2 times in the array

function countName(anArr, name){
    // We'll start by creating a counter that will keep track of the amount of times the input,
    // name, appears
    let count = 0;
    // Then we'll create a for-loop to iterate over the input array, anArr
    for(let i = 0; i <= anArr.length - 1; i++) {
      // Inside the loop we'll have an if-conditional so we can compare the current value of
      // the loop to the input, name. If they're === to each other, we'll add 1 to our 'count'
      // variable
      if(anArr[i] === name) {
        count++;
      };
    };
    // All we need to do now is return 'count!'
    return count;
};
